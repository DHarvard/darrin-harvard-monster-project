# darrin-harvard-monster-project CHANGES
```
-Used Vuetify to make changes
-Took code and organized it using a MonsterProject.vue file then imported it into the App.vue
-Added VContent in which I call my MonsterProject
-Added a VToolbarTitle
-Added VContainer
-Added VLayout and VFlex (Played around with these two components but there is still a lot I need to learn. I got confused on how it works)
-Added VBtn to change all of the buttons that were being used and style them. I used rounded buttons and gave them a ripple effect for the game controls, and I made the start button a block button and used 'dark' to style it.
